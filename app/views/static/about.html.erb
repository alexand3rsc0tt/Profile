<h3>About</h3>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<p>I'm a drummer and my drumming carrer has taken me to march with 
	Riverside City College also known to be "Hollywood's Band". In the year 2012 I did
	a music video with Travis Barker and Yellow Wolf and a commercial for the game 
	Just Dance 4. That gave me the chance to participate in the Pasadena Rose parade
	of 2013. The following new years I traveled with the band to London and Madrid to 
	march in the London New Years parade and Madrids Cabalgata de Reyes parade.</p>
